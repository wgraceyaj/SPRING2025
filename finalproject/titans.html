        <h2>About the Titans</h2>
        <p>
            Each Subject of Ymir (Eldians) has the ability to become a Pure Titan. This is different from an Intelligent Titan because 
            Pure Titans are mindless and their only purpose is to eat humans. Pure Titans stay as a titan forever until they pass. Intelligent Titans possess unique powers that are 
            specific to that Titan they possessed. Intelligent Titans are able to go back into their human form.
        </p>
        <p>
            The original Founder Titan, Ymir, only lived for 13 years as a Titan so those that posses a Intelligent Titan have a lifespan of 13 years before they have to 
            find an heir to their Titan otherwise their Titan will be passed along to someone random that is a Subject of Ymir. The proccess to become a Intelligent Titan is the 
            Subject of Ymir has to become a Pure Titan which if from a intake of a Titans spinal fluid, then eating someone in their Pure Titan form that possess an Intelligent Titan.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most Pure Titans aren't active at night because they rely on the sunlight for energy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Those that inherit Intelligent Titans are able to see the memories of past Titans.

        <h2>Ackermans</h2>
        <p>
            The Ackermans are like Titans but in human form. They aren't able to regenerate like Titans but has a supernatural strength. 
            They used to be the guards of the royal family because of how strong they are. Because they aren't Eldians, their memories can't be 
            munipulated and they aren't able to turn into Titans. Since the King isn't able to control them, he feared them and ended up bring Ackermans to the brink of 
            extinction which is why those that are Ackermans don't know why they are so strong and their background.
